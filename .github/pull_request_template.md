## Summary of changes

## Merge checklist

- [ ] Bump the package version by running `npm version [patch | minor | major]` from the command line (if applicable).

> **Note:** In the context of Core Primitives, significant changes to the library or workflow, or removing primitives would be considered a major update, adding or updating primitives would be considered a minor update, and fixing primitives would be considered a patch. Non-code changes (e.g. documentation) do not require a version bump.
