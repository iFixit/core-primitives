# Contributing

## Local development setup

Follow these steps to get the project setup on your local machine:

```shell
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/iFixit/core-primitives.git && cd core-primitives

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

# Adding or Updating Primitives

## 1. Create a new branch

Create a new branch for your changes:

```shell
git checkout -b <branch>
```

## 2. Commit and push changes

Apply your changes to `index.json`, and keep `index.d.ts` in sync.

## 3. Test your build

Run `npm run build` and verify `core-primitives.css` and `core-primitives.less` are correct.

## 4. Open a pull request

Use GitHub to [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request) for your branch.

## 5. Bump the package version

After your pull request has been approved, bump the package version by running:

```shell
npm version [major | minor | patch]
```

Running [`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version.html) will build, bump the version, and write the new data to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. It will also create and push a version commit and tag.

> **Note:** In the context of `@core-ds/primitives`, significant changes to the library or workflow, or removing primitives would be considered a major update, adding or updating primitives would be considered a minor update, and fixing primitives would be considered a patch. Non-code changes (e.g. documentation) do not require a version bump.

## 6. Publish to NPM

```shell
npm publish
```

## 7. Create a release

After your pull request has been merged, [create a new release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) to document your changes. Use the tag you generated in step 4 to create the release.
