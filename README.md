## Installation

```shell
npm install @core-ds/primitives
```

## Usage

### JavaScript

After installing the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@core-ds/primitives), you can import Core Primitives into any JavaScript/TypeScript file. Here's an example of how you can use Core Primitives with styled-components:

```js
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { color, space } from '@core-ds/primitives'

const Example = styled.div`
  color: ${color.white};
  background-color: ${color.blue};
  padding: ${space[4]};

  &:hover {
    background-color: ${color.blueDark1};
  }
`
```

### Less

Core Primitives are [globally available](https://github.com/iFixit/ifixit/blob/master/Objects/ScriptView.php) as [Less variables](https://unpkg.com/@core-ds/primitives/core-primitives.less) in every Less file in the [ifixit/ifixit](https://github.com/ifixit/ifixit) repo. Here's an example of how you can use Core Primitives in a Less file:

```less
.example {
  color: @color-white;
  background-color: @color-blue;
  padding: @space-4;

  &:hover {
    background-color: @color-blue-dark-1;
  }
}
```

See the complete list of Less variables [here](https://unpkg.com/@core-ds/primitives/core-primitives.less).

## Contributing

### Local development setup

Follow these steps to get the project setup on your local machine:

```shell
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/iFixit/core-primitives.git
cd core-primitives

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Adding or updating primitives

#### 1. Create a new branch

Create a new branch for your changes:

```shell
git checkout -b <branch>
```

#### 2. Commit and push changes

Apply your changes to `index.json`. Don't forget to keep `index.d.ts` in sync with `index.json`.

#### 3. Open a pull request

Use GitHub to [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request) for your branch.

#### 4. Bump the package version

After your pull request has been approved, bump the package version by running:

```shell
npm version [patch | minor | major]
```

[`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version.html) will bump the version and write the new data back to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. It will also create and push a version commit and tag.

> **Note:** In the context of Core Primitives, significant changes to the library or workflow, or removing primitives would be considered a major update, adding or updating primitives would be considered a minor update, and fixing primitives would be considered a patch. Non-code changes (e.g. documentation) do not require a version bump.

#### 5. Merge into master

After your pull request has been approved and the package version has been bumped, go ahead and [merge the pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/merging-a-pull-request) into master. You don't have to worry about publishing to npm because we have a GitHub action set up to automatically publish the package when a commit is pushed to master.

#### 6. Create a release

After your pull request have been merged, [create a new release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) to document your changes. Use the tag you generated in step 4 to create the release.
